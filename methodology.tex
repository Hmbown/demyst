\subsection{Reproducibility}

All experiments are tracked using the Demyst scientific integrity framework.
The code is available at [REPOSITORY URL] and includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete training scripts with fixed random seeds
    \item Exact hyperparameter configurations
    \item Data preprocessing pipelines
    \item Evaluation scripts
\end{itemize}

A reproducibility checklist following~\cite{pineau2020improving} is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:reproducibility}.
